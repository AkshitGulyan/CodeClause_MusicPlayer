# CodeClause_MusicPlayer
Music Player completely made in Python with the help of Tkinter by Akshit Gulyan 


It is a local Music Player where you can play your local music files by adding them to the player.
It contains many options like play, pause, stop, next song, previous song, song traversal, etc.

I've used many libraries to complete this project such as Tkinter, PyGame, Pillow, etc.
